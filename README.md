# 9 Project: Honeypot

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

# Which Honeypots I deployed

For this exercise I only deployed the 1 given Honeypot, I had already run into some issues (highlighted below) and wanted to keep it simple for troubleshooting.

# Issues I encountered

On this project I encounted an issue of not being able to access my MHN login page. This was because HTTP was not enable for my VM on GCP, this should probably be included inthe project spec. Also at first my nmap was not installed which required a sudo install that could have been said as well. My sensor was not working at first to even get my 1 attack but on a redo it worked fine so that was an easy fix. 
# Summary 

I got 12 attacks including the one that I created on my sensor. I found it interesting that they were coming from all over the globe, not just from the US or one specific location.
